# SafariBlocker
Get Control over pop-ups in Safari!

Inspired by the tweak TabBlocker (http://cydia.saurik.com/package/com.droomone.tabblocker/). So props to the DEV for the idea.

Are you tired of advertisement pop-ups or pop-up tab's opening automatically in Safari? If yes, then this tweak is for you!

SafariBlocker will show you an alert with the following actions, when a website tries to open a new tab
 - Allow once
 - Whitelist Domain
 - Blacklist Domain
 - Blacklist URL

Also when a tab is blocked when it meets your preferences, a small toast message will be shown letting you know that the tab was blocked!
You can manage the above preferences in a organized list in the tweak settings.
